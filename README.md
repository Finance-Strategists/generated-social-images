`$ npm install`

## Instructions
- The project uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to create a JavaScript bundle
- JavaScript edits should only be in `index.js`
- After you edit your codes, just run the command below and it will create the `bundle.js`:  
`$ npm run build`  
- Alternatively, you can also run:  
  `$ npm run start:dev`
  - This command will watch your edits and apply the changes real-time.

## Building for Production
