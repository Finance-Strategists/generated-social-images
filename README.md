## Instructions

- JavaScript edits should only be on `app.js`
- After you edit your codes, just run the command below and it will create the `bundle.js`:  
`$ npm run build`  
- Alternatively, you can also run:  
  `$ npm run watch`
  - This command will watch your edits and apply the changes real-time.
